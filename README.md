# Parallel Performance Measurement
## Purpose
In this task, we are examining a read-mostly database with two data stuructures: skiplist and concurrentHashMap. After simulating a read-mostly database, we use Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) to test the efficiency of each method. 

## Tools/Skills Used
1. Java Concurrency 
2. Read/Write Lock with an emphasis on reading
3. JMH 
4. JFreeChart
5. Maven

## Program Results
TO BE ADDED.
